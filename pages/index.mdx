# Introduction
 
This is Owocki endgame.

It is a playful adaptation of the concept of an [endgame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame) in chess, to the development & evolution of Gitcoin as a DAO.

What is an endgame?

> In chess and other similar games, the endgame (or end game or ending) is the stage of the game after the middlegame. The endgame begins when few pieces are left on the board.

At a high level, you can think of this resouce as a way of compiling thinking about Gitcoin's endgame into one place.

## Repo structure 

The endgame repo takes into account two perspectives.

### 1. Owocki perspective 

Deeply opinionated & created by Kevin.   No consensus process has been followed to created this perspective, but the following research was done:
1. Interviews with Rune & Kain.
2. Close working process with Kyle + with Michael Kriak.
3. Watching all of the CSDO livestreams
4. Reading all of the gov forums.
5. Drawing on 6 years as a Gitcoin co-founder.

### 2. Consensus perspective.

A mostly empty repo (right now), but contains an fork & merge process to be followed by anyone create a consensus version of the endgame by different parties.  Anyone can fork the repo and provide their own view of Gitcoin's endgame.

## What this repo is

To discuss what this repo is.. lets first discuss what it is NOT.

### What this repo is NOT

This repo is NOT a command & control style dictum of what Gitcoin's strategy is.  [A DAO has no CEO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-dao-has-no-ceo/9852), and legitimacy at Gitcoin comes from [other places](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778).

### What is this repo then?

This repo is a place to articulate, debate & eventually form consensus around different visions of what Gitcoin's endgame is.

Different forks of this repo will serve different parts of this discussion.
1. The *opionated forks* are meant to stimulate disussion about strategy.
2. The *consensus perspective* are meant to be strategy that can actually be followed.

## How do you use this repo?

1. Read
2. Discuss - Use Github Issues, gov.gitcoin.co, or twitter, to debate any part of this.
3. Propose
4. Repeat until you reach the Quadratic Lands.
