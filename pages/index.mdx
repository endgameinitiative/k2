# Introduction
 
This is Owocki endgame.

It is a playful adaptation of the concept of an [endgame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame) in chess, to the development & evolution of Gitcoin as a DAO.

What is an endgame?

> In chess and other similar games, the endgame (or end game or ending) is the stage of the game after the middlegame. The endgame begins when few pieces are left on the board.

At a high level, you can think of this resouce as a way of compiling thinking about Gitcoin's endgame into one place.

## What is the endgame?

To discuss what the endgame is... Lets dive deeper into what this resource is.. and what it is NOT.

### What this resource is NOT

This resource is NOT a command & control style dictum of what Gitcoin's strategy is.  [A DAO has no CEO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-dao-has-no-ceo/9852), and legitimacy at Gitcoin comes from [other places](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778).

This resource embraces plurality of perspectives.

### What is this resource then?

This resource is a place to articulate, debate & eventually form consensus around different visions of what Gitcoin's endgame is.

Different forks of this resource will serve different parts of this discussion.
1. The *opionated forks* are meant to stimulate disussion about strategy.
2. The *consensus perspective* are meant to be strategy that can actually be followed.

Ideally the relationship between these branches will look something like this:

```
                                    vision A1
                                   /         \
    vision A -> discussion & debate           \
  /                                            \ merge back to consensus
 /                                              \
---------------------------------------------------- consensus fork

```

but sometimes a vision will be created that does not get a reaction or get merged into the consensus fork.

```
    vision B -> discussion & debate -> no action taken
  /                                          
 /                                       
---------------------------------------------------- consensus fork

```

perhaps if we are super committed to evolving our strategy together, then multiple consensuses will start to merge & share ideas with each other.

```

---------------------------------------------------- CSDO consensus fork
              \
               \ idea exchange
                \
---------------------------------------------------- token holder consensus fork

```


as multiple consensuses compete in the marketplace of ideas, it will be useful to illuminate where there is profound disagreement in the path forward.

```

---------------------------------------------------- CSDO consensus fork
              x
               x disagreement
                x
---------------------------------------------------- token holder consensus fork

```


## How do you use this resource?

1. Read
2. Discuss - Use Github Issues, gov.gitcoin.co, or twitter, to debate any part of this.
3. Propose
4. Repeat until you reach the Quadratic Lands.


## Repo structure 

The endgame repo takes into account two perspectives.

### 1. Owocki perspective 

Deeply opinionated & created by Kevin.   No consensus process has been followed to created this perspective, but the following research was done:
1. Interviews with Rune & Kain.
2. Close working process with Kyle + with Michael Kriak.
3. Watching all of the CSDO livestreams
4. Reading all of the gov forums.
5. Drawing on 6 years as a Gitcoin co-founder.
6. Drawing on some of the whisper network knowledge about Gitcoin that tends to come one's way when one is works in public.

The Owocki perspective version of this endgame doc:
1. are meant to stimulate disussion about strategy (but are not meant to be taken as gospel).
2. are focused on what's best for the DAO (not whats best for any one constituent-set)
3. are focused on finding the high leverage points, [the upward spirals](https://community.supermodular.xyz/t/upward-spirals/289), and the hard trade-offs well ahead of time & in good faith.

### 2. Consensus perspective.

A mostly empty repo (right now), but contains an fork & merge process to be followed by anyone create a consensus version of the endgame by different parties.  Anyone can provide their own view of Gitcoin's endgame.

### Embrace pluralism.  View these other perspectives:

A list of different consensus perspective resources:
1. [Owocki endgame](https://endgame-git-main-owocki.vercel.app/)
2. TODO - invite Kyle to write one to the extent that his view differs from any of the forks.
3. TODO - maintain a CSDO fork of this repo or some other type of vision doc.
