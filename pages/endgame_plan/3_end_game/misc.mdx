# Miscellanous Ideas

Many of these need more meat on the bones.

## Narrative

Renaissance - a revival of or renewed interest in something.

This plan is the renewal of Gitcoin, it's Gitcoin's Renaissance.

## PGF

Todo - partner with Sov to write more about the program.  What is it's future business model/structure?

Some ideas
1. take fee by being in the round
2. more PGFs in the main gitcoin round
3. reengineer it a la https://twitter.com/chaserchapman/status/1691851085269684637

## elder steward council

The steward council model has not yet taken off.. 

Lets copy the traditional company advisory board model.  What if we invited top founders in the space (Kain, Sassal, etc)... and asked them to be on a steward council where they acted as an advisory board)?

## Ecosystem Engagement

Become more Ecosystem first, 

- Copy Optimism mission and intents
- Build each workstream for ecosystem participation.
- working in public is a superpower - Embrace scale that comes with decentralization As a value
- use gitcoin to build gitcoin
- We could articulate Vitalik style roadmaps on path forward/ the path to PMF.


## Governance 

how governance got captured. Show context and power overlap (have i already done this in the airdrop + ?? sections)

shawn: Encourage large delegators to reduce delegation to less than 2.5% of a normal snapshot vote - and lead by example. In my calculation, that is a cap at about 250,000 delegated tokens. Need more delegates? We just elected 8 kick ass people to the steward council. Give them some influence. Not sure you know or agree with them all yet? Well, yeah that is kinda how deliberate diversity works.

## Financials

add in a economic model
VeGTC
Mara - make ppl stake to run grants rounds up until x amounts
Put eth into rETH treasury

# GTM
gtm
Waterfall in every market
Repitition of core value props
	for chrome it was security speed stability

## Go all in on optimism.

Optimism is the new market leader in the regen space ($20m/quarter), time to fall inline in their ecoysystem and get aligned with them.

## turn up the clock speed 

We can iterate faster, to explore the PMF design space faster.  Instead of doing 6 week iterations, what if we do 1-2 week iterations?

## - invite others to write their endgame docs. 

The endgame document would be powerful if it was more like the Federalist papers for gitcoin.  We should make sure that CSDO has shared ownership over endgame.

## Embrace network effects.

Network effects are magic.  We can leverage them to create exponential growth.

## Marketing
## Analytics

Shout it from the rooftops: we are so back.  market the return of each product.
devrel plan for allo

Stop flying blind, invest in analytics/data infrastructure.

## Establish more aggressive goals than 13-5-5 for next 6 months.

Something more like 5m-50-5-0
- 5m GTC staked
- 50 Granst Stack Rounds
- 5 Allo integrations
- 0 breakeven on PGN

## Sybil Data Infrastructure

Provide as much sybil resistence to as many dApps as possible + Stay head of the attackers.  All while being decentralized.

Build a data science ecosystem to avoid capture.

## Aqueduct

Revive it? https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-aqueduct/9684

## Superchain

superchain but for grants stack
Allo super structure

## GTC

GTC is the governance token of the Gitcoin network.  It creates security against sybil attackers, spammers, or other negative behaviour.
Write about GTC Staking
- in passport
- on grants stack/allo
- in allo

### GTC Utility

staking on rounds
staking on passport
staking to get your token on a list.

## TLDRs everywhere

todo add them on each doc

## todos

Articulate hypersturuftr at end of subdao proposal

stop booking Ls start booking Ws
external wins vs internal ones
