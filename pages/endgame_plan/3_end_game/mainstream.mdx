Did you know that Quadratic Funding works outside of web3?

We've proven it a couple of times.
1. 2020 - We ran a campaign called downtown stimulus that was able to successfully raise $43k for 6 downtown businesses in Boulder Colorado [source](https://twitter.com/dtstimulus/status/1305838829245329408).
2. In 2021 - we ran a campaign called FundOSS which raised $95k for web2 era Open Souce projects [source](https://twitter.com/_FundOSS/status/1410604319498407942)

The psychology (give $1, the project gets $10-$100 depending on how many other contributors fund it) works just as well outside of web3.

Once Gitcoin has achieved saturation in web3, it could consider moving into web2.

Of course, this would mean a lot of 
1. product work to hide blockchain in the back
2. relationships work to build revenue flows needed to run these rounds.

[Here](https://www.notion.so/gitcoin/Proposal-Fiat-donations-direct-on-ramping-to-PGN-c58eccd9d5814f6e84e28e4bcf4bb2d1) is an evaluation of what it would take to do so.

TAM of providing these services to mainstream government is in the trillions [[1]](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13FwaqQ0CmQQ-DcPNZRK2oJ77LzbG7yOtpR9uftt7VEs/edit#slide=id.g256648f42fb_0_0) [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_government_budget) [[3]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V6cX4CS7W0dobQcRZEBrT6gKGNZyCXLQ/edit#gid=1149117666)
