# Context Decentralization

## Problem Statement

There is a context gap between those who follow Gitcoin governance religiously and those who dont.

This was driven by the increased complexity and need for context associated with the refactor of the organization from company to DAO in 2021-2023.

There was a clear division between stewards that were core contributors to Gitcoin, and stewards who were outside community contributors.  Over time, the latter contributors were not able to contribute and eventually stop tstewarding the project at all.

## Solution

We propose that Gitcoin invest in LLMs that make it easier to understand the whole Gitcoin political economy.

The LLMs would watch gov.gitcoin.co, notion, Gitcoin youtubes, twitter, and any other relevant channels, and consume the context of the Gitcoin political economy.  They would then expose an interface that would allow anyone to have as much context as anyone else just by asking questions.

There are two teams that are working on doing this as service, and we propose that we hire them to do this service.
- DAOStewards.xyz working on this 
- TBD on other one.  TODO: Kyle to ask his DAO governance tg
