# What is Gitcoin?

## Gitcoin offers the following products:

1. Grants Stack - An end-to-end grants solution customized to your needs.
2. Allo Protocol -  An open-source protocol that enables groups to efficiently and transparently allocate pooled capital.
3. Passport - A privacy perserving sybil resistence aggregator.
4. PGN - An L2 for public goods projects to earn funding.
5. GTC - The governance token for Gitcoin.

## What problem does each of these products solve, and for home?

### Grants Stack

1. Any EVM-based ecosystem that wants to build ecosystem value by funding what matters in their ecosystem.
2. Any project within that EVM-based ecosystem that wants to get funding for their dApp.
3. Any consumer within that ecosystem that wants to discover and/or fund new dApps, initiatives, or projects.

### Allo Protocol

Developers who want to integrate Quadratic Funding, Quadratic Voting, retroactive public goods funding, or any other capital allocation mechanism into their app.
Developers who want to create an alternative to Grants Stack.


### Passport

1. Ecosystems that easy sybil resistence for their ecosystem.
2. Users who want to earn rewards within those ecosystems.

### PGN

Developers who want to earn revenue for their dApps.

### GTC

People who want to govern Gitcoin.

## How do all of these things fit together?  

1. They were built to service each other, but opened up new business lines for Gitcoin.
    - Passport was built to solve the service Gitcoin Grants by providing it with sybil resistence.
    - GTC was built to solve the governance problems of Gitcoin Grants.
    - PGN was launched to solve the funding for Gitcoin Grants.
    - Grants Stack was launched to get DAO Treasuries to fund Gitcoin Grants.
    - Allo protocol was launched to make Gitcoin Grants decentralized & modular.
        - Why does GG need to be modular?  Because Quadratic Funding is not the only capital allocation method out there.  We envision a handful of capital allocation mechanisms, each solving one thing and doing it well (unix phillosophy style).  Original Gitcoin grants was a pocketknife, Allo protocol is a swiss army knife with many complementary tools on it.
        - Why does GG need to be decnetralized?  Decentralization provides censorship resistence, democratic decision making, and easy forkability.
2. They solve the cold start problem for one another + build network effects together.
