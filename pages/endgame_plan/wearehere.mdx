# What is Gitcoin?

Gitcoin offers the following products:
1. Allo Protocol -  An open-source protocol that enables groups to efficiently and transparently allocate pooled capital.
2. Grants Stack - An end-to-end grants solution customized to your needs.
3. Passport - A privacy perserving sybil resistence aggregator.
4. PGN - An L2 for public goods projects to earn funding.
5. GTC - The governance token for Gitcoin.

How do all of these things fit together?  
1. They were built to service each other, but opened up new business lines for Gitcoin.
    - Passport was built to solve the service Gitcoin Grants by providing it with sybil resistence.
    - GTC was built to solve the governance problems of Gitcoin Grants.
    - PGN was launched to solve the funding for Gitcoin Grants.
    - Grants Stack was launched to get DAO Treasuries to fund Gitcoin Grants.
    - Allo protocol was launched to make Gitcoin Grants decentralized & modular.
        - Why does GG need to be modular?  Because Quadratic Funding is not the only capital allocation method out there.  We envision a handful of capital allocation mechanisms, each solving one thing and doing it well (unix phillosophy style).  Original Gitcoin grants was a pocketknife, Allo protocol is a swiss army knife with many complementary tools on it.
        - Why does GG need to be decnetralized?  Decentralization provides censorship resistence, democratic decision making, and easy forkability.
2. They solve the cold start problem for one another + build network effects together.
