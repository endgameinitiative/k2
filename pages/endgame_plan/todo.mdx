## Governance 

endgame how governance got captured. Show context and power overlap

decentralize governance 
shawn: Encourage large delegators to reduce delegation to less than 2.5% of a normal snapshot vote - and lead by example. In my calculation, that is a cap at about 250,000 delegated tokens. Need more delegates? We just elected 8 kick ass people to the steward council. Give them some influence. Not sure you know or agree with them all yet? Well, yeah that is kinda how deliberate diversity works.

## Superchain

Work superchain but for grants stack
Allo super structure
