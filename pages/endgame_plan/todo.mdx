## Narrative

Gitcoin Renaissance

## Subdao

PGF/MMM service subDAO .

## PGF

PGF - take fee by being in the round
more PGFs in the main gitcoin round
matrix orgs
Program - what it looks like in the mid game

elder steward council

## Ecosystem

ecosystem engagement
- missions and intents
- use gitcoin to build gitcoin
- subDAO launch framework
We could articulate Vitalik style roadmaps on path forward/ the path to PMF.

Become more Ecosystem first, 

- Copy Optimism mission and intents
- Build each workstream for ecosystem participation.
- working in public is a superpower - Embrace scale that comes with decentralization As a value

## Governance 

endgame how governance got captured. Show context and power overlap

decentralize governance 
shawn: Encourage large delegators to reduce delegation to less than 2.5% of a normal snapshot vote - and lead by example. In my calculation, that is a cap at about 250,000 delegated tokens. Need more delegates? We just elected 8 kick ass people to the steward council. Give them some influence. Not sure you know or agree with them all yet? Well, yeah that is kinda how deliberate diversity works.

## Superchain

Work superchain but for grants stack
Allo super structure

## Financials

economic model
VeGTC
Mara - make ppl stake to run grants rounds up until x amounts
Put eth into rETH treasury

# GTM
gtm
Waterfall in every market
Repitition of core value props
	for chrome it was security speed stability


## Go all in on optimism.

Optimism is the new market leader in the regen space, time to fall inline in their ecoysystem and get aligned with them.

# Compounding momentum


## Establish more aggressive goals than 13-5-5 for next 6 months.

Something more like 5m-50-5-0
- 5m GTC staked
- 50 Granst Stack Rounds
- 5 Allo integrations
- 0 breakeven on PGN


## evolve how we do work

Insert Diagnosis of Gitcoins current malaise - despite high quality team members indinvidually, some products are failing in market. market has passed it by. no sense of urgency, stuck in meta trap.. despite high sepnding, we missed ETHDenver 13-5-5 goals.

## turn up the clock speed 

We can iterate faster, to explore the PMF design space faster.


## - invite others to write their endgame docs. 

Federalist papers for gitcoin
On 9/1 Kevin will invite others to come up with their own endgame plan.


## Embrace network effects.

Network effects are magic.  We can leverage them to create exponential growth.

## Marketing
## Analytics

Shout it from the rooftops: we are so back.  market the return of each product.
devrel plan for allo

Stop flying blind, invest in analytics/data infrastructure.

## Sybil Data Infrastructure

Provide as much sybil resistence to as many dApps as possible + Stay head of the attackers.  All while being decentralized.

Build a data science ecosystem to avoid capture.
