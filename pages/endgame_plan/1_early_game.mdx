# Early Game 

Familiarize yourself here with the contours of the Gitcoin's early game here:

## Mission History

Weâ€™ve always been Mission-first, and open source (later all public goods) have always been at the heart of Gitcoin's ethos.  Here is the evolution of our articulation of our mission.

1. 2017 - Push Open Source Forward
2. 2018 - Grow Open Source
3. 2019 - Support Public Goods
4. 2020 - Build & Fund the Open Web
5. 2023 - Build, Fund & Protect What Matters

View the visual history of the mission [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-visual-history-of-gitcoins-mission-2017-2022/10049) and the latest ratified version of our mission is [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoins-adopted-mission-and-vision-statements/15039).

## Corporate History

1. Gitcoin was founded in 2017.
2. Gitcoin was a company from 2017-2021 and became a DAO in 2021.
3. The DAO evolves every quarter since then.

Gitcoin's history is embedded in the history of the ecosystem from which it was borne.  Gitcoin evolved within Ethereum and

1. was conceived and launched in a bull market - 2017
2. when it had to evolve or die in the bear market of 2018-2020, it pioneered Gitcoin Grants, Gitcoin Hackathons, Gitcoin DAO, and KERNEL.
3. in the 2021 bull market it grew in contributor size and evolved a lot.
  - Gitcoin Hackathons + KERNEL spin out in 2022, and the primary thing that "is Gitcoin" becomes Grants & the DAO.
4. when it had to evolve or die in the bear market of 2022-??, it pioneered Grants Stack/Allo Protocol/Passport/PGN.


## Team History

1. Gitcoin was a team of 5-12 2018 - 2020.
2. That team [turned over in 2021](https://avc.com/2013/08/mba-mondays-turning-your-team/).
3. The Gitcoin Holdings Inc. team grew to 30 & the DAO grew to ~ 65 full time contributors.
4. The Gitcoin Holdings Inc team [disaffiliated from the DAO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passing-the-torch/10971) in 2022.
5. That team [turned over in 2022-2023](https://avc.com/2013/08/mba-mondays-turning-your-team/).
5. Current team size as of 8/2023 is about 40-50 people.  [More here](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Contributor-Database-9f25a9785c2948e4a1e3aa35bc155c30).

You can read about the history of the cofounding team at Gitcoin [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/knowledge-transfer-who-is-a-cofounder-of-gitcoin/11371).


## Product History

1. Gitcoin Bounties (later evolved into Gitcoin Hackathons) 2017 - 2022.
2. A bunch of product experiments 2018-2022 (Gitcoin Labs, Gitcoin Kudos, Codefund by Gitcoin, Gitcoin Quests, Coordination Kit) that mostly didnt work out except for one (Gitcoin Grants).
  - Gitcoin Bounties/Hackathons spun out in 2022 to become [buildbox.io](https://buidlbox.io/)
  - Gitcoin KERNEL spun out in 2022 to become [KERNEL](https://www.kernel.community/en/).
  - Gitcoin Labs, Quests, Kudos, Codefund all eventually became inactive.
3. Gitcoin Grants starts as a subscription service where you can subscribe to your favorite OSS projects using [EIP 1337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1337).  It launches in Jan 2019 but does not get traction in market.
4. Gitcoin Grants is reconceived as a Quadratic Funding Tool in Feb 2019 and Gicoin Grants Round 1 ($25k match) launches.
5. Gitcoin Grants evolves every quarter and grows most quarters to $8m funding/quarter in 2022.  You can follow the evolution [here](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1540257178233106433) and [here](https://vitalik.ca/categories/gitcoin.html).
6. In ~ 2020 we realize that public goods funding tools should be decentralized & that a company is not the right model for Gitcoin Grants.  On May 25 2021 Gitcoin DAO launches.
7. In 2021, we begin work on a new tool called dGrants and it [almost ships in Dec 2021](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1469283258617630723).
8. In early 2022, dGrants doesnt work out and [Gitcoin Grants 2.0 is conceived](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-grants-2-0/9981)
9. In early 2023 an [alpha](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-gitcoin-alpha-tests) and [a beta](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/follow-up-gitcoin-program-beta-round-eligibility/13837) ships.
  - In mid 2023, the old centralized Grants program, cGrants, [sunsets](https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1674515887079186432).
10. In 2022, Gitcoin Passport ships and Gitcoin enters the sybil resistence identity game ([passport could be big imo](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/passport-is-our-aws/10995)).
11. In 2023, [publicgoods.network launches](https://cointelegraph.com/news/open-source-advocates-launch-op-stack-testnet-to-fund-public-goods) to solve the [race to the bottom](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/public-goods-funding-the-race-to-the-bottom/15739) of public goods funding.   
12. In 2023, [Allo protocol v2 launches](https://allo.gitcoin.co/) as does [Grants stack](https://www.gitcoin.co/grants-stack).
12. As of 8/2023, current primary offerings:
  - Allo Protocol - protocol for capital allocation
  - Grants Stack - web UI for allo protocol
  - Passport - sybil aggregator
  - Publicgoods.network - layer 2 
  - GTC - Governance token

[DAOs are like slime molds](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1456368527347044355), and like many complex adaptive systems or organizations with big missions, there is a tree structure to Gitcoin's product evolution that has evolved over time + we've made decisions about where to double down & where to reduce resource consumption so we could create focus elsewhere.  Here is a visual overview of the launch, lineage, & evolution of Gitcoin's major products.
