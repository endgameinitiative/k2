# Product Adoption

Gitcoin is several seed stage products:
    1. Passport
    2. Grants Stack 
    3. Allo 
    4. PGN
    5. GTC

How do these products win?

## Grants Stack


Top of the funnel

Get adopted into as many EVM communities\ as possible.
Land & expand - Provide a swiss army knife of capital allocation methods.
start w top tier brands.

Metamask
Linea (talking to), Zksync Era, Polygon (Evaluation), Arbitrum
Bankless, Coinbase Advocacy
FWB,

L2s => DEFI => NFT => Any EVM based community
DEFI => SNX, AAVE, Maker, Uniswap

Marketing cover + ground game
ppl cutting grants rounds.  direct grants/bounties not tho.
    pressure test whether ppl are just being polite?

how do we make the impact of QF rounds more mreasurable for communities.


## Allo Protocol



Allo Glimmers of hope
    EnDAOment
    Sablier
    Impact Stream
    Hats protocol
    Privy/Celo

A tool that grows with you
1. direct grants
2. direct grants w community counsel
3. QF
4. 

TODO - YOLO / "Gateway drug rounds".

TODO - write more about the strategy here.

## Passport

Provide as much sybil resistence to as many dApps as possible.

Stay head of the attackers.

Build a data science ecosystem to avoid capture.

TODO - write more about the strategy here.


## PGN

Provide as much funding to regen projects as possible.
Provide cheap block space to users.

TODO - write more about the strategy here.

## GTC

GTC is the governance token of the Gitcoin network.  It creates security against sybil attackers, spammers, or other negative behaviour.

1million GTC has been staked in order to provide more sybil resistence in market.  We should triple down on this.  And also add utility for Allo elsewhere

## Vertical integration

Each of the products are players in their niches, but they are not the biggest player in their niches.  
    - Passport is smaller than Worldcoin
    - Grants Program is smaller than OPtimism RPGF.
    - PGN is smaller than other L2s.
    - Allo is inchoate.

The vertically integrated stack of these products can win via
    - leveraging **vertical integration** to provide a seamless experience between the products.
    - leveraging **network effects** to bootstrap each product individually.
    - Leveraging Gitcoin's **strong brand** to move outside of web3 (UNICEF, American Cancer Society)

That said, the vertically integrated product suite provides its own challenges too.  Each product could be it's own startup.  Focus will be key to making sure each team can focus on their own outcomes.
