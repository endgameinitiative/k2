# Maximize product market fit

Gitcoin is several seed stage products in one DAO:
    1. Passport
    2. Grants Stack 
    3. Allo 
    4. PGN
    5. GTC

How do these products win?

## Passport

Provide as much sybil resistence to as many DAOs as possible.
Stay head of the attackers.

TODO - write more about the strategy here.

## Grants Stack
## Allo Protocol

Get adopted into as many DAOs as possible.

TODO - write more about the strategy here.

## PGN

Provide as much funding to regen projects as possible.

TODO - write more about the strategy here.

## Vertical integration

Each of the products are players in their niches, but they are not the biggest player in their niches.  
    - Passport is smaller than Worldcoin
    - Grants Program is smaller than OPtimism RPGF.
    - PGN is smaller than other L2s.
    - Allo is inchoate.

The vertically integrated stack of these products can win via
    - leveraging **vertical integration** to provide a seamless experience between the products.
    - leveraging **network effects** to bootstrap each product individually.
    - Leveraging Gitcoin's **strong brand** to move outside of web3 (UNICEF, American Cancer Society)
