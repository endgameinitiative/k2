# GG19 Feedback

Gitcoin Grants Round 18/19 came with a lot of feedback from the community.

You can read the community feedback below:

This might be reductionist.. But I will attempt to summarize the feedback below:

- GG17 was on a L1, causing very high gas fees.
- GG17 DEI Round, especially with a controversial community member on the review committe, is not a public good.
- GG18 Partnership with Shell is bad & is greenwashing.
- Generally, Round Acceptance is unclear
- Passport is hard to verify + get above 20 points.
- Generally, Gitcoin out of touch with community.
- Generally, Gitcoin has gone away from it's roots (OSS Funding)
- Generally, UX is bad.



Reset is hard - that there is reaction is good.
