## Specific plans

### 1. Maximize product market fit

1. Gitcoin is 4 seed stage startups in one economic trench coat
    1. articulate Vitalik style roadmaps on path forward/ the path to PMF for:
    1. Passport
    2. Grants Stack => direct grants, QF, etc
    3. Allo 
    4. PGN
    5. GTC

1. How we win in market 
    - for each product, and for the products at large.
        - vertical integration
        - network effects
        - good brand
    - turn up the clock speed to explore the PMF design space faster
    1. Shout it from the rooftops: we are so back.  market the return of each product
            7. devrel plan for allo
            7. Stop flying blind, invest in analytics/data infrastructure.

3. Compounding momentum
    0. Meta: how we do work
        1. Diagnosis of Gitcoins current malaise - despite high quality team members indinvidually, some products are failing in market. market has passed it by. no sense of urgency, stuck in meta trap.. despite high sepnding, we missed ETHDenver 13-5-5 goals.
    8. Establish more aggressive goals than 13-5-5 for next 6 months.
    0. all in on optimism.
    2. Another airdrop
        3. add performance bonuses to comp structure
    15. Endgame - invite others to write their docs. Federalist papers for gitcoin
    6. Ecosystem first, Copy Optimism mission and intents
        - Build each workstream for ecosystem participation.
        - working in public is a superpower - Embrace scale that comes with decentralization As a value
