## Specific plans

### 1. Maximize product market fit

0. What has taken so long?
    1. Diagnosis of Gitcoins current malaise - despite high quality team members indinvidually, some products are failing in market. market has passed it by. no sense of urgency, stuck in meta trap.. despite high sepnding, we missed ETHDenver 13-5-5 goals.
    2. We spent 24 months rewriting the entire stack - legal, governance, people, product, tech
    3. Gitcoin is 4 seed stage startups in one economic trench coat
1. articulate Vitalik style roadmaps on path forward/ the path to PMF for:
    1. Passport
    2. Grants Stack
    3. Allo 
    4. PGN
    5. GTC
1. How we win in market for each product, and for the products at large.
    - vertical integration
    - network effects
    - good brand
    - turn up the clock speed to explore the PMF design space faster
3. Compounding momentum
    0. all in on optimism.
    0. working in public is a superpower. 
    1. Shout it from the rooftops: we are so back 
    2. Another airdrop
    3. add performance bonuses to comp structure endgame
    4. stop falling into https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-meta-trap/10666
    5. Network effects.
    6. Copy Optimism mission and intents
    7. Stop flying blind, invest in analytics/data infrastructure.
    8. Establish more aggressive goals than 13-5-5 for next 6 months.
    9. Fix our devrel, blanked the market with “Gitcoin protocol(s) r here”.
    10. Establish Elder Steward Council with actual web3 founders/innovators.
    11. Build each subdao/workstream for ecosystem participation.
    12. Gitcoin is a political economy, not a company
    13. working in public is a superpower - Embrace scale that comes with decentralization As a value
    14. a way to prioritize feedback - on gov forum - based on stakeholders
    15. Endgame - invite others to write their docs. Federalist papers for gitcoin
