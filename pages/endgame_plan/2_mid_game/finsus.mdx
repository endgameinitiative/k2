# Financial sustainability.


The next several years will see investments in experiments that will bring revenue + treasury appreciation to Gitcoin to offset the treasury outflows.

These will be accomplished with a combination of revenue inflows + managing the spend of the outflows.

## Timeline

- Next 6 months: staking + revenue experiments.
- 18 months: deep utility, programatic slashing, conviction curation.


## Gitcoin Tokeneconomics

Incentive Engineering (ty to Electric Capital)
The art and science of designing economic mechanisms and governance systems that form the basis for a healthy and defensible network, ecosystem and community

Why GTC?
GTC offers a way to create and govern internet scale protocols and programs that evolve in the service of all community participants. Practically this means:
- Govern Gitcoin’s Grants program
- Reward contribution and align incentives between community members and the network they are building
- Act as a community script for participation in products (ie, identity staking)
- Decentralize decision making on core protocol & product areas

Why do people own GTC today?
The goal is to push every strategic decision to the community (through token voting) with the DAO being a major voice, but not the deciders.
- Speculation
- Decision making on DAO operations and workstreams
- Control over grants rounds decisions (ie, how large are rounds, who is eligible, how are funds allocated, etc.)
- Future fee share split from the protocols
- Future curation of grants in the grants rounds (ie, featured grants or changes to sort order, etc.)
- Formalizing partnerships between aligned communities to govern and participate accordingly

How do we think about incentivizing actions in the Gitcoin Ecosystem?
- Reward positive sum contributions (ie, Gitcoin’s initial airdrop to those funding and building public goods)
- Reward participation where users are incurring risk (staking on their identity and being a good actor)
- Amplify matching pool rewards based on positiver sum actions of community members (curation and staking on projects).
