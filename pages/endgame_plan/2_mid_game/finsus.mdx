# Financial sustainability.


The next several years will see investments in experiments that will bring revenue + treasury appreciation to Gitcoin to offset the treasury outflows.

These will be accomplished with a combination of revenue inflows + managing the spend of the outflows.

Next 6 months: staking + revenue experiments.

18 months: deep utility, programatic slashing, conviction curation.


TODO need to write more about this.
