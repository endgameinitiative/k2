# Compounding momentum


## Meta: how we do work

Diagnosis of Gitcoins current malaise - despite high quality team members indinvidually, some products are failing in market. market has passed it by. no sense of urgency, stuck in meta trap.. despite high sepnding, we missed ETHDenver 13-5-5 goals.

## Establish more aggressive goals than 13-5-5 for next 6 months.

Something more like 5m-50-5-0
- 5m GTC staked
- 50 Granst Stack Rounds
- 5 Allo integrations
- 0 breakeven on PGN

## all in on optimism.

Optimism is the new market leader, time to fall inline in their ecoysystem.

## - invite others to write their docs. Federalist papers for gitcoin

## Ecosystem first, Copy Optimism mission and intents
- Build each workstream for ecosystem participation.
- working in public is a superpower - Embrace scale that comes with decentralization As a value
