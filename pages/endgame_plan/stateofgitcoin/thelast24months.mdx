# The Decentralization Layer Cake

The last 24 months have been spent decentralizing Gitcoin.

## Why?

Gitcoin was meant to be a DAO, not a company, because

1. As a public goods dapp, we didnt want to be centralized intermediary or forever extracting from our users to pay back our investors.  
2. We wanted to leverage our favorite properties of DAOs
		- democratic decision making
		- invite participation from anywhere
		- supermodularity
		- credible neutrality
3. we wanted to dogfood: use the procuct to fund the creation of the product.

## What

It turns out that turning a company into a DAO is a multi-layered approach.

The last 24 months have been spent on this Decentralization Layer Cake ðŸŽ‚: 

1. Legal - a foundation for the DAO that the nation-state understandss.
2. Governance - how decisions are made, how legitimacy is distributed.
3. People - who contributes to the DAO's mission
4. Product - what products, protocols, and experiences, does the DAO release?
5. Computation - where is the computation executed & who has control of upgrade paths?
6. Funding - who pays for what?
