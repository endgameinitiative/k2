# Where we've been.

The last 24 months have been spent decentralizing Gitcoin.

## Why?

On May 25 2021, Gitcoin became a DAO.

In 2020, Kevin & Kyle decided Gitcoin was meant to be a DAO, not a company, because:

1. As a public goods dapp, we didnt want to be centralized intermediary or forever extracting from our users to pay back our investors.  
2. We wanted to leverage our favorite properties of DAOs
		- democratic decision making
		- invite participation from anywhere
		- transparency
		- supermodularity
		- credible neutrality
3. the next generation of our product is for DAOs.  and we wanted to dogfood like a DAO would: use the product to fund the creation of the product.

## What

It turns out that turning a company into a DAO necessitates a multi-layered approach.

The last 24 months have been spent on the *Decentralization Layer Cake* üéÇ: 

1. Legal - a foundation for the DAO that the nation-state understandss.
2. Governance - how decisions are made, how legitimacy is distributed.
3. People - who contributes to the DAO's mission
4. Product - what products, protocols, and experiences, does the DAO release?
5. Computation - where is the computation executed & who has control of upgrade paths?
6. Funding - who pays for what?

I wrote about some of the struggles in this journey [here](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1656683662862155777).

The good news is that the Decentralization Layer Cake has been built (in some cases, it's been built & rebuilt more than once).  But we are back ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.  Gitcoin has the proper foundation to innovate again.
