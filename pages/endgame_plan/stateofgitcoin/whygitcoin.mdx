# Why does the world need Gitcoin?

Gitcoin envisions a world shaped by community-led positive change.

But what does that mean?  Is it just marketing fluff?

The data says it is not. Gitcoin has had $50m worth of direct impact so far ( https://impact.gitcoin.co/ ), and secondarily, it 
1. has shown that pro-social, protopian, or mission-centric crypto projects are possible to a generation of builders.  
2. is building protocols & products that others can use to increase the bottoms up coordination in their own projects.

As humanity collectively evolves from the industrial age to the information age, the world is in the midst of massive change.  
1. The internet revolutionized everything that was built upon information (newspapers, media, social media, entertainment) by allowing computers to send information across computer networks.
2. I believe that the internet of finance could revolutionize everything built upon value (investments, insurance, collectiables, work, how we fund the commons) because we can now send value across computer networks.

Within the context of this civilizational scale upgrade to the finacial system, Gitcoin is focused on the following high-leverage points:
1. Gitcoin provides tools to enable community-led capital allocation with Allo Protocol & Grants Stack.
2. Gitcoin provides tools to enable sybil resistence & more a democratic DAO ecosystem with Gitcoin passport.
3. Gitcoin stimulates a social movement towards more regenerative cryptoeconomic ecosystem by channeling capital, talent, research, and memes towards other regen projects..

Over the last 24 months, we have seen Gitcoin copycats pop up in many other ecosystems.   Why are these copycats popping up?  Because *funding your ecosystem's public goods* is a sustainable competitive advantage.

How do we leverage this to get to our next stage of growth?

## The next stage of growth: $50m => $500m

Gitcoin has had $50m worth of impact so far ( https://impact.gitcoin.co/ ).  What does the path to $500m look like?

Simple: We just give ecosystems [the same tools that worked for Vitalik last cycle](https://vitalik.ca/categories/gitcoin.html).

Grants Stack & Allo allow anyone to do Quadratic Funding.  But now that Gitcoin Grants is decentralized & modular, we can build for a pluralitiy of capital allocation mechanisms.

1. Quadratic Funding
2. Milestone based payouts
3. Quadratic Voting 
4. Retroactive Public Goods Funding
5. Direct Grants
6. Many many more capital allocation mechanisms we've not yet dreamed up. [more here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/systematic-exploration-of-the-coordination-mechanism-design-space/12616)

Along with the ability to compose any sort of Grants program possible, Gitcoin delivers best practices to each community, allowing them to fund what matters in their ecosystem

                                                      allocation strategies into their products & communities

```

## The stage after that: $500m => $5bn


Once the EVM community is funding it's own ecosystems, we envision that this momentum could be leveraged to fund non web3 ecosystems.

To do this, 
1. The momentum within web3 must be strong (eg. 100 EVM communities using Allo-based tools).
2. Our tools must be usable enough for mainstream users (eg. you dont need to know about private keys/txns, you can use fiat, can use the tools on mobile)
3. There must not have been a black swan event that destroys crypto (eg. it's regulated away from being useful, outright banned, or technical black swans like quantum computing which are all still threats.)
