# Where are we going?

## Goals 

Ensure Gitcoin is:
- Mid game - **Stabilized** - Roadmaps aligned, teams are executing, and DAO burn is normalized to high measurable ROI investments.
- Mid game - **Thriving** - financially, socially and technically. Gitcoin will continue to be a model for sustainability and DAO excellence.
- End game - **Decentralized** across governance, protocol advancement, token holder representation, computation (where applicable).
- End game - **Lucrative** - for those participating, for those integrating, for those with ambition and those willing to invest. (Not just financially, but socially, emotionally  and technologically)

## Values

Other values to adhere to along the journey:
- Mission alignment
- Ethereum alignment
- Co-op values, mutualism, non plutocracy
- Simplicity at the center, Complexity to edges
- Outside Legitibility
- Incentive Alignment
- Momentum & Network Effects
- Pragmatism

## Core Elements

This Endgame Plan consists of the following main components, in sequence:
1. Maximize Product market fit.
2. Financial sustainability.
3. Ossify core.

### Tradeoff space

There are tradeoffs between these value & goals.  

One of the primary ones is market successs vs decentralization.  Here is a visual of Gitcoin's journey along these two axises:

Over the course of endgame, it will be necessary to weigh these tradeoffs and sequence work in a pragmatic way.  In  the endgame plan, we will call out these values & surface recommended paths through tradeoffs, but it'll be up to governance to decide the path through..
