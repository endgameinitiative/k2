# TLDR

## What is Gitcoin?

Gitcoin's mission is to create technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund and protect what matters.  Tangibly, Gitcoin is 

1. an **impactDAO** which acts as a social & educational schelling point for experiments in regenerative cryptoeconomics 
2. & a **protocolDAO** that has deployed the following products:
    1. **Grants Stack** - An end-to-end grants solution customized to your needs.
    2. **Allo Protocol** -  An open-source protocol that enables communities to efficiently and transparently allocate pooled capital.
    3. **Passport** - A privacy perserving sybil resistence aggregator.
    4. **PGN** - An L2 for public goods projects to earn funding.
    5. **GTC** - The governance token for Gitcoin.


Gitcoin has had $50m+ worth of impact so far (https://impact.gitcoin.co).  The endgame plan charts a course to 100x growth to $5bn of impact over the coming decade.

Success is not guaranteed.  But if we coordinate to set up [the right flywheel](/endgame_plan/stateofgitcoin/wearehere#network-effects) + breathe momentum into it, with a little luck and skill, wagmi.

## Goals 

Ensure Gitcoin is:
- Mid game - **Stabilized** - Roadmaps aligned, teams are executing, and DAO burn is normalized to high measurable ROI investments.
- Mid game - **Thriving** - financially, socially and technically. Gitcoin will continue to be a model for sustainability and DAO excellence.
- End game - **Decentralized** across governance, protocol advancement, token holder representation, computation (where applicable).
- End game - **Lucrative** - for those participating, for those integrating, for those with ambition and those willing to invest. (Not just financially, but socially, emotionally  and technologically)

## Core Elements

This Endgame Plan consists of the following main components, in sequence:
1. Maximize Product market fit.
2. Financial sustainability.
3. Ossify core.
