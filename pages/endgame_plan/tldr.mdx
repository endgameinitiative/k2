# TLDR

## Endgame in one sentence

Endgame is a plan to engineer Gitcoin's Rennaisance. The primary components of this plan are
1. promoting product adoption
2. get it financially thriving
3. create a flywheel
4. eventually ossifying the project.

## Endgame in one paragraph

Gitcoin is a political economy of four different products under the same umbrella.  Endgame is a plan to engineer Gitcoin's Rennaisance by (1) tuning it's product adoption, (2) getting it thriving financially, (3)create a positive flywheel, and thereby achieve it's north stars: to fund the worlds public goods + create a more democratic web.  Eventually, (4) Gitcoin will ossify into a very simple core with complexity at the edges - products will break into subDAOs where matters related to each individual protocol can be managed.

### What is Gitcoin?

Gitcoin's mission is to create technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund and protect what matters.  Tangibly, Gitcoin is 

1. an **impactDAO** which acts as a social & educational schelling point for experiments in regenerative cryptoeconomics 
2. & a **protocolDAO** that has deployed the following products:
    1. **Grants Stack** - An end-to-end grants solution customized to your needs.
    2. **Allo Protocol** -  An open-source protocol that enables communities to efficiently and transparently allocate pooled capital.
    3. **Passport** - A privacy perserving sybil resistence aggregator.
    4. **PGN** - An L2 for public goods projects to earn funding.
    5. **GTC** - The governance token for Gitcoin.


Gitcoin has had $50m+ worth of impact so far (https://impact.gitcoin.co).  The endgame plan charts a course to 100x growth to $5bn of impact over the coming decade.

Success is not guaranteed.  But if we coordinate to set up [the right flywheel](/endgame_plan/stateofgitcoin/wearehere#network-effects) + breathe momentum into it, with a little luck and skill, wagmi.

### Goals for this plan

To us, a good endgame plan is:
1. Values aligned
1. Maximizing the accomplishment of Gitcoins mission
1. Pragmatic/Do-able
1. Comprehensive - it seperates concerns & considers tradeoffs between them
1. Will create financial sustainability (ideally financial thriving)
1. Will mean ultimately decentralizing or ossifying Gitcoin.
1. Will be ratified by governance eventually

### Goals for Gitcoin

> People overestimate what can be done in one year, and underestimate what can be done in ten. ~ Bill Gates

Ensure Gitcoin is:
- Mid game - **Stabilized** - Roadmaps aligned, teams are executing, and DAO burn is normalized to high measurable ROI investments.
- Mid game - **Thriving** - financially, socially and technically. Gitcoin will continue to be a model for sustainability and DAO excellence.
- End game - **Decentralized** across governance, protocol advancement, token holder representation, computation (where applicable).
- End game - **Lucrative** - for those participating, for those integrating, for those with ambition and those willing to invest. (Not just financially, but socially, emotionally  and technologically)

### Core Elements

This Endgame Plan consists of the following main components, in sequence:
1. Maximize Product Market fit.
2. Financial sustainability.
3. Ossify core.
