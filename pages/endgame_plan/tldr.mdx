# TLDR

## Endgame in one sentence

Endgame is the plan to artciluate Gitcoin's path forward. The primary components of this plan include
1. promoting product adoption
2. financially thriving
3. create a flywheel
4. eventually ossifying the project.

## Endgame in one paragraph

Gitcoin is a political economy of four different products under the same umbrella.  Endgame is the plan to artciluate Gitcoin's path forward by (1) tuning it's product adoption, (2) getting it thriving financially, (3) create a positive flywheel of network effects, and thereby achieve it's north stars: to fund the world's public goods + create a more democratic web.  Eventually, (4) Gitcoin will ossify into a very simple core with complexity at the edges - products will break into subDAOs where matters related to each individual protocol can be managed.

### What is Gitcoin?

Gitcoin's mission is to create technologies and opportunities that enable communities to build, fund and protect what matters.  Tangibly, Gitcoin is 

1. an **impactDAO** which acts as a social & educational schelling point for experiments in regenerative cryptoeconomics 
2. & a **protocolDAO** that has deployed the following products:
    1. **Grants Stack** - An end-to-end grants solution customized to your needs.
    2. **Allo Protocol** -  An open-source protocol that enables communities to efficiently and transparently allocate pooled capital.
    3. **Passport** - A privacy perserving sybil resistence aggregator.
    4. **PGN** - An L2 for public goods projects to earn funding.
    5. **GTC** - The governance token for Gitcoin.


Gitcoin has had $50m+ worth of impact so far (https://impact.gitcoin.co).  The endgame plan charts a course to 100x growth to $5bn of impact over the coming decade.

Success is not guaranteed.  But if we coordinate to set up [the right flywheel](/endgame_plan/stateofgitcoin/wearehere#network-effects) + breathe momentum into it, with a little luck and skill, wagmi.

### Goals for this plan

To us, a good endgame plan is:
1. Values aligned
2. Fulfills our purpose
3. Pragmatic/Do-able
4. Comprehensive - it seperates concerns & considers tradeoffs between them
5. Will create financial sustainability (ideally financial thriving)
6. Will mean ultimately decentralizing or ossifying Gitcoin
7. Will be ratified by governance

### Goals for Gitcoin

> People overestimate what can be done in one year, and underestimate what can be done in ten. ~ Bill Gates

Ensure Gitcoin is:
- Mid game - **Stabilized** - Roadmaps aligned, teams are executing, and DAO burn is normalized to high measurable ROI investments.
- Mid game - **Thriving** - financially, socially and technically. Gitcoin will continue to be a model for sustainability and DAO excellence.
- End game - **Decentralized** across governance, protocol advancement, token holder representation, computation (where applicable).
- End game - **Lucrative** - for those participating, for those integrating, for those with ambition and those willing to invest. (Not just financially, but socially, emotionally  and technologically)

### Core Elements

This Endgame Plan consists of the following main components, in sequence:
1. Maximize Product Market fit.
2. Financial sustainability.
3. Ossify core.
