# TLDR

## What is Gitcoin

Gitcoin's mission is to fund what matters.  Tangibly, Gitcoin is 

1. a impactDAO which acts as a social & educational schelling point for experiments in regenerative cryptoeconomics 
2. & protocolDAO that has deployed the following products:
    1. Grants Stack - An end-to-end grants solution customized to your needs.
    2. Allo Protocol -  An open-source protocol that enables groups to efficiently and transparently allocate pooled capital.
    3. Passport - A privacy perserving sybil resistence aggregator.
    4. PGN - An L2 for public goods projects to earn funding.
    5. GTC - The governance token for Gitcoin.


Gitcoin has had $50m worth of impact so far (https://impact.gitcoin.co).  The endgame plan charts a course to 100x growth to $5bn of impact over the coming decad.

Success is not guaranteed.  But if we coordinate to set up [the right flywheel](/endgame_plan/stateofgitcoin/wearehere#network-effects) + breathe momentum into it, with a little luck and skill, wagmi.

## Goals 

The Goals for the endgame are to ensure Gitcoin is:

1. (mid-game, 18 months) as **successful** as possible in achieving it's mission.
2. (mid-game, 18 months) **thriving** financially (not just *sustainable*).
3. (end-game, 4 years) **decentralized** at the layers of governance, product, tokenholder, and computation.
4. (end-game, 4 years) **reduce overhead** by cutting scope creep & relentlessly promoting focus.
5. (evergreen) **force trade-offs** in timing, resourcing, & other tradeoff spaces in order to chart a clear course to goals 1-5.

## Core Elements

This Endgame Plan consists of the following main components, in sequence:
1. Maximize Product market fit.
2. Financial sustainability.
3. Ossify core.
