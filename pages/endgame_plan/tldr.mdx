2. (mid-game, 18 months) **thriving** financially (not just *sustainable*).
3. (end-game, 4 years) **decentralized** at the layers of governance, product, tokenholder, and computation.
4. (end-game, 4 years) **reduce overhead** by cutting scope creep & relentlessly promoting focus.
5. (evergreen) **force trade-offs** in timing, resourcing, & other tradeoff spaces in order to chart a clear course to goals 1-5.
