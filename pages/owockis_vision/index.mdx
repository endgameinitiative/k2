# Goals 

The Goals for the endgame are to ensure Gitcoin is:

1. (mid-game, 18 months) as **successful** as possible in achieving it's mission.
2. (mid-game, 18 months) **thriving** financially & socially (not just *sustainable*).
3. **decentralized** at the layers of governance, computation, tokenholder, and computation.
4. (end-game, 4 years) **reduce overhead** by cutting scope creep & relentlessly promoting focus.
5. (end-game, 4 years) **force trade-offs** in timing, resourcing, and other pragmatic tradeoff spaces in order to chart a course to the above goals.

Other values to adhere to along the journey:
- Ethereum alignment
- Non plutocracy
- Complexity to edges
- Outside Legitibility
